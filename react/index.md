shadow dom - is a new dom feature to create a custom component
-- Shadow DOM is hidden DOM tree attached to elements in regular DOM
-- Shadow DOM elements aren't affected by CSS, conversely the CSS in the shadow root won't affect the regular DOM


1. ### What is React?

    React is an **open-source frontend JavaScript library** which is used for building user interfaces especially for single page applications. It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. React was created by [Jordan Walke](https://github.com/jordwalke), a software engineer working for Facebook. React was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012.

    
2. ### What are the major features of React?

    The major features of React are:

    * It uses **VirtualDOM** instead of RealDOM considering that RealDOM manipulations are expensive.
    * Supports **server-side rendering**.
    * Follows **Unidirectional** data flow or data binding.
    * Uses **reusable/composable** UI components to develop the view.


3. ### What is JSX?

    *JSX* is a syntax extension to JavaScript (the acronym stands for *JavaScript XML*). Basically it just provides syntactic sugar for the `React.createElement()` function, giving us expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax.

    In the example below text inside `<h1>` tag is returned as JavaScript function to the render function.

    ```jsx harmony
    class App extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return(
          <div>
            <h1>{'Welcome to React world!'}</h1>
          </div>
        )
      }
    }
    ```

4. ### What is the difference between Element and Component?

    An *Element* is a plain object describing what you want to appear on the screen in terms of the DOM nodes or other components. *Elements* can contain other *Elements* in their props. Creating a React element is cheap. Once an element is created, it is never mutated.

    The object representation of React Element would be as follows:

    ```javascript
    const element = React.createElement(
      'div',
      {id: 'login-btn'},
      'Login'
    )
    ```

    The above `React.createElement()` function returns an object:

    ```
    {
      type: 'div',
      props: {
        children: 'Login',
        id: 'login-btn'
      }
    }
    ```

    And finally it renders to the DOM using `ReactDOM.render()`:

    ```html
    <div id='login-btn'>Login</div>
    ```

    Whereas a **component** can be declared in several different ways. It can be a class with a `render()` method or it can be defined as a function. In either case, it takes props as an input, and returns a JSX tree as the output:

    ```javascript
    const Button = ({ onLogin }) =>
      <div id={'login-btn'} onClick={onLogin}>Login</div>
    ```

    Then JSX gets transpiled to a `React.createElement()` function tree:

    ```javascript
    const Button = ({ onLogin }) => React.createElement(
      'div',
      { id: 'login-btn', onClick: onLogin },
      'Login'
    )
    ```

    5. ### How to create components in React?

    There are two possible ways to create a component.

    1. **Function Components:** This is the simplest way to create a component. Those are pure JavaScript functions that accept props object as first parameter and return React elements:

        ```jsx harmony
        function Greeting({ message }) {
          return <h1>{`Hello, ${message}`}</h1>

        }
        ```

    2. **Class Components:** You can also use ES6 class to define a component. The above function component can be written as:

        ```jsx harmony
        class Greeting extends React.Component {
          render() {
            return <h1>{`Hello, ${this.props.message}`}</h1>
          }
        }
        ```

   6. ### When to use a Class Component over a Function Component?

    If the component needs *state or lifecycle methods* then use class component otherwise use function component.
    *However, from React 16.8 with the addition of Hooks, you could use state , lifecycle  methods and other features that were only available in class component right in your function component.*
    *So, it is always recommended to use Function components, unless you need a React functionality whose Function component equivalent is not present yet, like Error Boundaries *

    
7. ### What are Pure Components?

    *`React.PureComponent`* is exactly the same as *`React.Component`* except that it handles the `shouldComponentUpdate()` method for you. When props or state changes, *PureComponent* will do a shallow comparison on both props and state. *Component* on the other hand won't compare current props and state to next out of the box. Thus, the component will re-render by default whenever `shouldComponentUpdate` is called.

    
8. ### What is state in React?

    *State* of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component. We should always try to make our state as simple as possible and minimize the number of stateful components.

    Let's create a user component with message state,


    ```jsx harmony
    class User extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props)

        this.state = {
          message: 'Welcome to React world'
        }
      }

      render() {
        return (
          <div>
            <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>
          </div>
        )
      }
    }
    ```

    State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component. i.e, It is not accessible to any other component til the owner component decides to pass it.


    
9. ### What are props in React?

    *Props* are inputs to components. They are single values or objects containing a set of values that are passed to components on creation. They are data passed down from a parent component to a child component.

    The primary purpose of props in React is to provide following component functionality:

    1. Pass custom data to your component.
    2. Trigger state changes.

 1. ### What is Virtual DOM in React?  

        The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called reconciliation. ... They may also be considered a part of “virtual DOM” implementation in React

 2. ### Explain react lifecycle methods  
      Mounting  – render(), componentDidMount(), getDerivedStateFromProps()
      Update    – render() , componentDidUpdate(), shouldCompoenntUpdate(), getDerivedStateFromProps()
      Unmount   – componentWillUnmount

 3. ### what is babel?
      Babel is a JavaScript transpiler/compiler that converts edge JavaScript into plain old ES5 JavaScript that can run in any browser (even the old ones). It makes available all the syntactical sugar that was added to JavaScript with the new ES6 specification, including classes, fat arrows and multiline strings.

 4. ### how does the single page application works (SPA)   
      The SPA is a web application that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page, rather than loading entire new pages from the server. The main advantage of a single-page application is its speed 

 5. ### what are props       
    Props are inputs to components, They are data passed down from a parent component to a child component

 6. ### what are states
      State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component

  7. ### What is the difference between state and props?
      Both props and state are plain JavaScript objects. While both of them hold information that influences the output of render, they are different in their functionality with respect to component. Props get passed to the component similar to function parameters whereas state is managed within the component similar to variables declared within a function.

  8. ### what are keys in react ?
      Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity:
