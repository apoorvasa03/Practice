/** problem with callback is callback hell, consider u have more async function, ull have more nested function is execute with will end up in creating errors, cant read the programs */



/* what is callback hell */
/**
 Callback hell is a phenomenon that afflicts a JavaScript developer when he tries to execute multiple asynchronous 
 operations one after the other. By nesting callbacks in such a way, we easily end up with error-prone, hard to read, 
 and hard to maintain code.
